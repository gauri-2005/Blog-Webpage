    <h1>CORRUPTION</h1>

    <br><br>
    <p>A majority of us are probably aware of the term “corruption” and the situations in which the word perfectly fits in. The most plausible reference to the nature of corruption could be assessed by the words of Joe Bidden, 47th Vice President of the United States of America, who quoted: “corruption is just another form of tyranny.” The statement weighs corruption as equivalent to that of cruel and oppressive rule of government. However, for a common man/woman, corruption is a challenge, that he/she faces every day, in protecting of his/her fundamental rights and privileges, otherwise guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Corruption in India</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Though, the ranking of India in Global Corruption Index 2018 has been improved by three places; at a global rank of 78 it's still far from becoming a corruption free nation.
        Corruption in India had been prevalent even under the subjugation of British Empire, when India was still far from gaining independence. How deeply rooted was the corruption in Indian society, can be assessed by the words of Mohammed Ali Jinnah. The Muslim League Leader once stated - “One of the biggest curses from which India is suffering - I do not say that other countries are free from it, but I think our condition is much worse - is bribery and corruption. That really is a poison”.
        This statement of Mr. Jinnah delivered while addressing the first Presidential address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 11th August 1947, bares naked the truth of corruption in India, even before independence.
        Even after 73 years of Independence, not much has changed on that front for the people of India. On the contrary, corruption has grown in dimension and today, it seriously hampers the economical, social and infrastructural progress of the nation as never before.
        Corruption in political and administrative system of the country, is curtailing its progress and it devoid the people of India of their basic rights of equality, freedom, right to equal opportunity and right to compulsory education and health among others.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Factors Leading to or Responsible for Corruption</h3><br>
        <p>The corruption is rooted into several social, political and economical factors. Though, the most elaborate explanation for the cause of corruption could be estimated by the words of 19th century British politician Lord Acten, who had famously said - “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

            The quote was a reference to relationship between power and corruption. Corruption is most like to occur with power as the powerful can successfully evade accountability, by using his/her power and influence.
            
            The scenario explained above gels perfectly with the Indian political and administrative system of governance. Huge powers are vested upon our political representatives and administrative officials, by the Constitution. The motive behind bestowing them with power was the greater idea of empowering them to act as facilitators to the public, in general interest of the nation.
            
            They are expected to exercise their powers in implementing several welfare schemes and projects, without any hindrance, for the overall welfare of the people and progress of the nation. However, the whole idea seems to backfiring with, the powerful wielding the powers to their own interests, seriously compromising the interest of the nation and its people.
            
            This is when the corruption slowly seeps into otherwise honest political and administrative circles of India.
            
            Another, most troubling factor behind the prevalence of corruption in India is the latter's acceptance in society as a common phenomenon. Today, the voices against corruption are fainter than ever before and the people have accepted corruption as natural and unavoidable.
            
            This is the reason why we tend to bribe public servants, to escape the legal formalities on issues those are of interest to us. Moreover, giving and taking bribe is today being considered as a wise act and is being applauded in private, if not publically.
            <br><br>
            Below is given a point wise narration of other social and economical factors that could escalate corruption:</p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate compensation and monthly emoluments to the government employees could lead them to corruption.</li>
                <li>Illiteracy fuels corruption as it makes a person more submissive and likely to be exploited by greedy officials.</li>
                <li>Illiteracy, poverty and lack of a transparent grievance redressal system make people more vulnerable to political and other types of corruption.</li>
                <li>A decline of ethics and moral values in the society are also responsible for corruption.</li>
                <li>Lack of awareness among the people on their rights and privileges is acting as a fuel to the corruption.</li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <h3>Different Faces of Corruption</h3><br>
            <p>The demon of corruption has many faces, than could be imagined, like judicial corruption, governance corruption, corruption in education, corruption in enforcement of laws, financial corruption, political corruption etc. There could be thousands of other similar situations; those could act as examples of corruption. It wouldn't be possible to elaborate all types of corruption in this essay; however, we will discuss a few of them below.</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The spectrum of corruption is vast enough to affect people from different walks of life. It involves situations like bribing to secure a government job, bribing to lodge a complaint in local police station, bribing the government doctor for treatment, bribing the official for swift movement of file, paying bribe to the official to get the cheque that you deserve anyway.</li>
                <li>Firstly, we will make an assessment of political corruption in India. We all know that the credibility of a political representative is based on the transparent and unbiased election that he or she faces in order to be elected. Despite the Election Commission of India doing a commendable job every time to conduct free and fair elections, there are still some cracks in the otherwise impeccable election system.</li>
                <li>More often than not, during elections, we get stray news from throughout the nation, of voters being influenced by money or by wielding powers, by the contestants in election. Such acts amount to political corruption of highest degree and can adversely influence the democratic structure of the nation.</li>
                <li>Now let's consider the scenario of a government hospital which functions to provide free or subsidized medical facilities to all the citizens of India. The doctors deployed by the government in the hospitals are compensated adequately for their services; however, sometimes they are seen demanding money from patients to perform an operation or treatment, which should otherwise be performed free of cost. This is a perfect example of corruption in healthcare system.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>Likewise there are several examples of corruption in different sectors, depending on their nature and outcome.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Corruption - An Act of Collusion or Not</h3><br>
            <p>Corruption is basically an act of collusion between two parties; however, more often than not one party might be forced into the agreement by another party.

                Suppose, if a Public Works Department Engineer demands bribe from a civil contractor, for passing the bill for the portion of road constructed by the latter. In this case, though the demand is not obligatory on the contractor, he/she will mostly oblige considering the otherwise cumbersome process of proceeding legally against the demands. In this case the party who gives bribe is actually forced to do so by the party who demands it.
                
                On the contrary, there could be situations in which both the opposite parties have colluded willingly in order to mutually benefit each other. For example a non deserving candidate for a government job, pays bribe to the recruiting official, in order to secure the job.
                
                Nevertheless, whether forced or mutually agreed upon, corruption is an act of collusion, between two parties, which seriously compromises the privileges and rights of other individuals.</p>
